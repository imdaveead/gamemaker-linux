# GameMaker Studio 2 for Linux

This Repository is two parts:
- a script for installing GameMaker Studio 2 on Debian-based machines
- a modified version of my [gamemaker-rubber](https://github.com/imdaveead/gamemaker-rubber) utility, to be used with the install script.

## Install
You will need
- A debian based computer (requires: `apt-get`, `bash`, `sudo`)
- An internet connection

download and install setupstudio2
```sh
wget https://davecode.me/setupstudio2
chmod +x ./setupstudio2
sudo ./setupstudio2
```
> The file on my website is just a redirect to the repository, faster to type

A second terminal window should open with more detailed instructions on what to do with all the GUI
elements and setup instructions.
